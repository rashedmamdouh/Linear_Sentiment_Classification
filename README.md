# Linear_Sentiment_Classification
It seems like you have a specific set of steps in mind for a project related to sentiment classification using neural networks. Let's break down each step:

1. **Quick Theory Validation**:
   - In this step, you might want to validate the theoretical foundations of your project. This could involve researching existing sentiment analysis techniques, understanding neural network architectures suitable for NLP tasks, and ensuring you have a solid grasp of the underlying concepts.

2. **Creating the Input/Output Data**:
   - This step involves preparing your data for training and testing your sentiment classification model. Task includes data collection, preprocessing, and splitting your dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Building a Neural Network**:
   - Here, you'll design and implement the neural network architecture for sentiment classification. Specify the layers, activation functions, and any other components of your neural network.

4. **Reducing Noise in Our Input Data**:
   - Noise reduction is crucial for improving the accuracy of your sentiment classification model. You might employ techniques like text cleaning, stopwords removal, and handling of special characters or emojis. Additionally, consider strategies for handling imbalanced data or outliers.
